# Review Papers
  - A review of signal processing techniques for heart sound analysis in clinical diagnosis: 2012, Journal of Medical Engineering & Technology
    - concludes drawbacks of phonocardiogram (PCG) for clinical diagnosis include (important!!!):
      - failure to present information on frequency of heart sounds and their components;
      - inability to differentiate between separate frequencies of various sounds as well as lack of information on the energy variations in various sounds;
      - presence of artefacts and noises that can visually mask weak heart sounds;
      - problems of identifying specific heart sound boundaries.
